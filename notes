Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of 
SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. It provides 
a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands
 (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary
  functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting
   execution. This concept is important: execute commands locally or remotely. 
   Locally means in your laptop (physical laptop or inside your Vagrant), 
   and Remotely means on your server(s). Fabric is taking care of all network 
   connections (SSH, SCP etc.), itâ€™s an easy tool for transferring, executing, 
   etc. commands from locale to a remote server.
